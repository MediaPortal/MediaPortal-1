- create a sql called "{new schema version}_update_sqlserver_database.sql" and "{new schema version}_update_mysql_database.sql" 
- add them to the project and embed the file as resource ("Add existing item" -> right click on the file, choose properties, select "Build Action=Embedded Resource")
- DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE SOURCECODE
- NO LEADING ZEROES in the schema version

So for the next extension the two files should be named:
  42_upgrade_sqlserver_database.sql
  42_upgrade_mysql_database.sql
  
You can use "xx_upgrade_sqlserver_database.sql" and "xx_upgrade_mysql_database.sql" as a starting point
