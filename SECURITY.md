# Reporting Security Issues

The Mediaportal team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate
your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort
to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/MediaPortal/MediaPortal-1/security/advisories/new)
feature.

The super-linter team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask
for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party software to the person or team maintaining
the third-party software.
