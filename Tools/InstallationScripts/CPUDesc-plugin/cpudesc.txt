NSIS plug-in for getting a bit of CPU information.
Version 1.2, July 2003.
Typed and clicked by Peter Mason, CSIRO DEM MMTG.  mailto://peter.mason@csiro.au.
The MHz timing was done using code that was pretty much copied from Pavlos
Touboulidis' CPUTEST code.
The lean exception handler wrapped around the timing code was done using Jeremy
Gordon's tutorial on writing lightweight win32 exception handlers in assembler.
(His web-page is www.GoDevTool.com.)
The CPUID stuff was done using Intel and AMD's manuals on what CPUID means to them.


There's only one routine here - tell() - and its output is a string on the NSIS
stack.   This string always has the same fields in exactly the same place.
(It's easier to extract values that way.)   It looks like this:

INTELP=d AMD=add PPRO=b MMX=d SSE=b SSE2=b 3DNOW=d ARCH=dd LEVEL=dd NCPU=dd MHZ=ddddd RAM=dddd

Here, "d" means a decimal digit (0..9), "a" means an alphabetic character (A..Z) and
"b" means a boolean digit (0 or 1).

ITELP: Values range [0..4].
  0:    Not a genuine Intel CPU (or a very, VERY old one).
  1:    Pentium or Pentium with MMX.
        (Check the MMX field if you want to know about the CPU's MMX support.)
  2:    Pentium Pro, II or Celeron.
        (May or may not have MMX - PPros don't, the others do.  Check the MMX field.)
  3:    Pentium III or P3 (old) Xeon.   (Always has MMX and SSE.)
  4:    Pentium IV or (new) Xeon.   (Always has MMX, SSE and SSE2.)
AMD:    A bit more complicated...
  000:  Not an authentic AMD CPU (or a very, VERY old one).
  Kdd:  An old K-series.   "dd" is either 05 for a K5 or 06 for a K6.
        (Pentium compatible.   K5s have no MMX or 3DNOW.   K6s have standard MMX,
        and later models have basic 3DNOW.)
  Add:  An Athlon or a Duron.   "dd" is the model number (goes from 01 to 10).
        (Pentium II compatible.   All of these have extended MMX and extended 3DNOW.
        None have any SSE.)
  Odd:  An Opteron.   "dd" gives the model number.
        (Pentium IV compatible.   This CPU's got everything, it seems.)
PPRO:   Values range [0..1].
  0:    Not compatible with the Intel Pentium Pro processor.
  1:    Compatible with the Intel Pentium Pro processor.
MMX:    Values range [0..2].
  0:    No MMX support.
  1:    Standard Intel MMX support.
  2:    Standard MMX support plus AMD MMX extensions.
SSE:    Values range [0..1].
  0:    No SSE support.
  1:    Supports SSE (Intel's Streaming SIMD extensions, P3-style).
SSE2:   Values range [0..1].
  0:    No SSE2 support.
  1:    Supports SSE2 (Intel's Streaming SIMD extensions 2, P4-style).
3DNOW:  Values range [0..2].
  0:    No 3DNOW support.
  1:    Standard AMD 3DNOW support.
  2:    Standard AMD 3DNOW support plus AMD 3DNOW extensions.
ARCH:   Values range [00..10].
  00:   32-bit Intel or compatible
  01:   MIPS (did NT 3.5, apparently)
  02:   DEC Alpha.   (Yes, DEC.   I can't bring myself to call it COMPAQ.)
  03:   PowerPC
  04:   SHX (?)
  05:   ARM (Acorn Risc Machine, I presume.   Running Windows?)
  06:   64-bit Intel.
  07:   64-bit Alpha
  08:   MSIL (?)
  09:   64-bit AMD
  10:   32-bit Intel doing Win64 (?)
LEVEL:  "Processor level", like what you see in the main processor environment
        variable.   Sort-of useless for Intel architecture.
NCPU:   The number of processors available.   (Affected by that "Hyper" business
        that the new XEONs can do, I think.)
MHZ:    The CPU's internal clock speed in MHz (Approx).
RAM:    The amount of RAM (physical memory) in megabytes (rounded).


SIMPLE EXAMPLE
Say you have an application BLOG for which you have two builds of the executable
BLOG.EXE:  BLOG_GEN.EXE compiled for "Processor = Blend" (a general build) and
BLOG_PRO.EXE compiled for "Processor = Pentium Pro" (will only work on a Pentium
Pro or compatible or better).   Now you want to copy the best one out when a user
installs BLOG.   You could have something like the following in your Install section:
  cpudesc::tell
  Pop $0                     ;full identification string in $0
  StrCpy $1 $0 1, 22         ;pull out one character after PPRO=
  IntFmt $2 "%u" $1          ; and turn it into a number
  IntCmpU $2 1 +1 +3 +3      ;Anything not Pentium II / Pro -compatible gets blog_gen
  File /oname=blog.exe "blog_source_directory\blog_gen.exe"
  Goto +2
  File /oname=blog.exe "blog_source_directory\blog_pro.exe"
	... the rest of your Install section
