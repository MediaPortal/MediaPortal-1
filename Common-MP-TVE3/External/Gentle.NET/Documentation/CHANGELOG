CHANGELOG

  2008-03-14  [v1.5.0] [1043:1237]
							This release is a wrap-up release with bugfixes and improvements made
							to Gentle since the last release. The project has been updated to use
							and support generics and can therefore no longer be used with .NET 1.1.
							The NullableType<T> structure should be supported, although this remains
							largely untested. Most provider libraries have been updated to recent
							releases. IPersistent has been refactored to use a bade interface IEntity
							that makes it easier to use Gentle in repository-style DALs.
							Note that Visual Studio 2008 is required for opening the project files.

  2004-04-22  Database script for SQLite added [ch].

  2004-04-21  Added full support for Oracle access using the OracleODP provider [as].

  2004-04-15  Fixed a bug that caused test cases to interact and fail when executed
              all at once. If you encounter a failing test case try to run it on its
              own before reporting a bug.

  2004-04-14  Fixed a bug that prevented the same column from appearing multiple
              times in the constraint list. Fixed a bug with paging and added test
              cases for both issues.

  2004-04-12  Added support for soft deleting objects with a concurrency column by
              setting the concurrency value to -1. Rows marked with a concurrency
              value of -1 will not be returned by any of the retrieve methods.

  2004-04-11  Added support for dynamically specifying the table name (see the Key
              class and ITableName interface for details on usage). Added support
              for paging (Next/Previous) to SqlResult.

  2004-04-09  Fixed a missing type conversion for Oracle users [Andreas Seibt,
              Petrel].

              [v1.0.1]
  2004-04-08  Added support for generating a DataView from an SqlResult. The
              analyzer for SQL Server now supports obtaining the identity columns.
              Fixed a bug in SqlResult where column names would only be available
              if rows were retrieved.

  2004-04-05  Fixed a number of bugs that would prevent test cases from running if
              concurrency control was disabled.

              [v1.0.0]
  2004-04-04  Added support for Enum properties (will be persisted as integers).
              Introduced a new sample parent class (GentleBase) providing defaults
              for the primary key field as well as concurrency control. Changed the
              Member class to test the new base class.

  2004-04-03  Added support for automatic concurrency control (update statements
              only) using the ConcurrencyControlColumn attribute. Added a new
              configuration key "Options/ConcurrencyControl" to allow Gentle to
              ignore the concurrency attribute. Applied a number of minor fixes
              kindly reported back by users.

              [v0.9.9]
  2004-03-21  Updated the UserRole test cases to not use reserved words and updated
              the database scripts for all databases. Applied a number of fixes for
              Oracle support [Andreas Siebt]. Various minor fixes throughout.

  2004-03-16  Fixed GentleList implementation [bugfixes; list content is no longer
              touched for n:m relations (relation management only); objects in 1:n
              lists are still managed]. Fixed a number of bugs for Oracle [Andreas
              Siebt].

  2004-03-14  Implemented list classes GentleList and GentleRelation for
              automatic management of 1:n and n:m relations. Added testcases for
              the Gentle list classes. Fixed a number of bugs affecting objects
              with aggregated primary keys.

  2004-03-13  Added support for Oracle [Andreas Siebt]. Minor bugfixes. Added
              reserved word checking for MS SQL Server and MS Access.

  2004-03-09  Renamed Config handler to GentleSectionHandler and the configuration
              section name to "gentle". Fixed the Transaction class. Passing an
              empty SqlResult to ObjectFactory.GetInstance now throws an error.

              [v0.9.8]
  2004-03-07  Added support for MS Access (Jet) [Vinicius (Vinny) A. DaSilva].

              limit and offset clauses to the SqlBuilder.

  2004-02-29  Implemented caching database metadata analyzer for SQL92 compliant
              engines (replaces SqlServerAnalyzer for MS SQL Server). Updated the
              NAnt build scripts [Clayton Harbour].

  2004-02-26  Made ObjectMap.Construct return proper GentleExceptions. Fixed a
              bug where DateTime.MinValue would always translate to null. Fixed
              a bug causing Broker.Retrieve only to work when the Key contained
              primary key field(s). Fixed compilation on Mono.

              [v0.9.7]
  2004-02-24  Fixed a bug introduced in 0.9.6 that broke all error reporting. Added
              support for primary key detection to SqlServerAnalyzer. Added support
              for using SqlResults as In/NotIn constraint input to SqlBuilder.

              [v0.9.6]
  2004-02-22  Merged changes to use log4net for logging [Clayton Harbour]. Renamed

  2004-02-16  Added support for row limit (TOP) and order by clauses to SqlBuilder.
              Fixed a bug with property/column mapping [Clayton Harbour]. Fixed a
              bug where SqlBuilder in some cases would generate illegal sql for
              Operator.Equals. Added support for Operator.NotEquals.

              [v0.9.5]
  2004-02-15  Added support for Operator.In and Operator.NotIn constraints using
              an ArrayList of data elements and property name. Generalized the
              test cases for SQL factory verification to be provider independent.

  2004-02-14  Added fix for DateTime null handling (now works without setting
              DefaultValue). Added missing Error declarations and corresponding
              external message definitions.

              [v0.9.4]
  2004-02-09  Added partial metadata extraction for PostgreSQL.

              of convenience methods. Various minor improvements and fixes.

  2004-02-03  Extended TableColumn to allow specification of DbType, Size
              and DefaultValue. Added support for the new TableColumn properties
              throughout the framework.

              [v0.9.2]
  2004-02-02  Added support for converting between business objects and
              DataViews. Use the new CustomView attribute to declare views.

  2004-02-01  Started work on object caching using Michael Bouck's cache
              class. Use the TableName attribute to set caching strategy
              per type. Also started work on ObjectGraph for automatic
              join resolution.

  2004-01-31  Added a bunch of data accessor methods to the SqlResult class.
