
IMPORTANT NOTE(S)
  
  GENTLE IS NO LONGER OFFICIALLY MAINTAINED (but I will offer commercial
  support if anyone dares to use it in spite of this warning).
  
  This release is a wrap-up release with bugfixes and improvements made since 
  1.2.9 was released in the summer of 2006.

  Existing users: Please be sure to at least review the BREAKING CHANGES, 
  DOCUMENTATION, SOURCE CODE and CONTRIBUTORS sections below.
  
  
BREAKING CHANGES  
  
  Gentle 1.5.0 has been ported/upgraded to Visual Studio 2008 and the code base
  now requires .NET 2.0 to run.
  
  There are new generic accessors on the Broker, PersistenceBroker, Transaction 
  and ObjectFactory classes. For consistency, old methods returning ArrayList 
  instances have been upgraded to return generic List<T> instances (like the 
  new generic list access methods). This will break existing code if you 
  downcast the IList return type to ArrayList.
 
  I've updated provider libraries for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird and 
  DB2 to the most recent ones available. No code changes apart from namespace 
  updates were required to do this. However, these changes remain untested and 
  might therefore introduce bugs or exhibit modified behavior compared to the 
  much older versions.
  
  Please review the CHANGELOG for a more complete overview of changes.
  

DOCUMENTATION

  The wiki and issue tracker are currently offline, with no immediate plans to 
  restore them as they were. The best learning resources for Gentle are 
  therefore bundled with this release. The Documentation folder contains a PDF
  export of the original Wiki content along with API documentation for Gentle 
  itself.

  If someone wants to host the Wiki I'll be happy to supply the appropriate
  database backups (PostgreSQL dump files) and license files for restoring the 
  original content. I might also have Confluence XML backups that are database 
  independant but would need to investigate whether that is the case.
  

SOURCE CODE
  
  The source code is currently available at the following URL:
  
  	https://code.mertner.com:8443/svn/gentle/gentle/
  	
  Note that this URL might change in the future, although I'll try to keep it 
  around if possible. If you want a copy of the source and cannot find it, feel
  free to email me at morten@mertner.com
  	  
  The project home remains at SourceForge, where you can download the current
  release as well as access the support forums. Due to spammer abuse all 
  mailing list messages are moderated, and most likely I'll soon close down the
  mailing list facility altogether.

SUPPORT

  If you are using Gentle and would like commercial support, please contact me 
  through my business email at morten.mertner@codeworks.eu
  
  You are also welcome to try the SourceForge forums - people have generally 
  been very helpful and patient in helping to resolve other peoples issues.
  

UPGRADING

  Please review the CHANGELOG entries added since the version you are using and
  apply any changes as needed. If you find a "breaking" entry that is not 
  listed in the CHANGELOG, please let me know so I can fix it.


INSTALLATION

  Please review the included documentation first, in particular the Getting 
  Started and Using Gentle pages.
  
  You can find sample configuration files in the Configuration folder. You must
  use either a standalone Gentle.config or declare a section in App/Web.config.
  
  Please also remember to uncomment the provider libraries you wish to use, 
  make sure to reference them from your project so that they get copied to the
  bin folder, and to set a valid connectionString property for the 
  DefaultProvider tag in the configuration file.

  VS.NET HELP INTEGRATION

  Execute the register.bat file found in the Documentation/Help subfolder. This 
  will install the included .HxS and .HxC help files, which will provide you with 
  context-sensitive help lookup from within Visual Studio.

  You will need the tools H2Reg and MS VS.NET Help Integration Kit. If you do not
  have these tools, please visit the following link to learn about their use and
  where to obtain them: http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/VSHelpIntegration.asp

  COMPILING GENTLE
  
  You need Visual Studio 2008 or a compatible version of a build tool to compile
  Gentle. No precompilation steps should be necessary.
  
  You will also need to download and install the Microsoft Oracle Client in
  order to compile the Gentle.Provider.Oracle project.
  
  RUNNING THE TESTS
  
  You can find either database creation scripts or prepared database files for
  most of the databases supported below the Source/Gentle.Framework/Tests folder.
  Use these if you wish to run any of the included test cases.

  CODE GENERATORS
  
  Gentle is supported by both MyGeneration (http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com)
  and CodeSmith, two excellent template-based code generation tools. Both of 
  these tools are able to generate a Gentle prepared business object from an 
  existing database schema. 
  
  MyGeneration comes bundled with a Gentle.NET template and is the recommended 
  tool to use (the template offers the most features, is actively maintained, 
  works with the most database engines, and is able to generate code for an 
  entire database schema in one go). Use it, and create a complete Gentle-enabled
  data-access layer in less than a minute! 
    

CONTRIBUTORS

  Gentle was originally created by Morten Mertner and released as open source
  in january 2004. It was actively maintained for almost 3 years after the 
  initial release date culminating in a mature product with the 1.2.9 release
  in november 2006. 
  
  After this attention switched to producing a new version with fewer limitations 
  and better overall design. This task progressed at an ever slower pace as the 
  task proved to be fairly difficult and much too large for a single person to 
  overcome, and it was hard to maintain the belief that the effort was worthwhile
  given that all the interest was focused on LINQ and competing ORM products.
	Much code has been written and the source for Gentle 2.0 remains available if 
	anyone wants to tinker with it (it might not compile currently though).
  
  At this time I would like to extend a very special thanks to everybody who
  has been on board and helped out over the years, whether by answering forum
  posts, contributing code, reporting bugfixes or even just moral support.
  I'll not mention any names so as not to forget anybody, but you know who you
  are! 
  
  I'd also like to thank all of the "Gentle fans" who have praised the ease
  of use, stability or performance of Gentle over the years. Without these
  the project would never have made it as fas as it did.

SPONSORS

  Gentle is kindly being sponsored by the following organisations:

  Atlassian (http://www.atlassian.com) has provided free open-source licenses to
  their issue tracker JIRA and the "wiki-on-steroids" collaboration tool Confluence.
  Apart from being outstanding tools I can also personally confirm that their email
  support rocks!

  Kayako (http://www.kayako.com) has provided a free license to their excellent
  HelpDesk software. Note that while the software itself was excellent, the support
  volume for Gentle in the end did not warrant the use of the software.
  
  Cenqua (http://www.cenqua.com) has granted a license for their source code 
  repository browser FishEye.

  *Thanks* for supporting Gentle, and the open source movement in general!
